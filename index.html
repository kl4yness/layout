              <p class="subtitle">
                Globel Finance is an innovative bonus and payment system
                of GLOBEL marketplace, which is designed to combine all the familiar
                advantages of marketplace bonus systems (discounts, bonuses,
                promotions) with the possibilities of digital blockchain technologies. At the heart of
                the system is based on Globel Token - a digital asset, which
                serves as a tool to get discounts when paying for goods and services and at the same time provides an opportunity to invest in the system.
                services and at the same time gives an opportunity to invest, bringing additional income to the owners.
                owners additional income. The main idea of Globel Finance is to
                is to give users full control over their reward points
                Globel Marketplace. Instead of them "burning out" or being
                tied to only one platform, the owner of a Globel Token
                can use it as a means of payment within
                Globel Marketplace, trade on exchanges, accumulate for
                investment. Thus, the bonus points are transformed into
                real digital currency, provided by the demand from the side of
                sellers, buyers and investors. Globel Finance creates
                an open ecosystem where all stakeholders -
                from ordinary buyers to large sellers, directly benefit
                benefit directly from the use of Globel Token. This makes the project
                flexible, accessible and potentially profitable for both ordinary
                users as well as experienced investors.

                value. Key Factors: Deflation by burning Some of the
                of issued tokens are periodically withdrawn from circulation. This
                reduces the overall supply and increases the value of the remaining
